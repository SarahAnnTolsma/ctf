            Welcome to the maybe-annual BillGO Capture-The-Flag ("CTF") exercise. We're happy to you chose to participate
            and test or hone your skills as a reverse engineer. Please keep in mind that the goal of the BillGO CTF is to
            have fun -- if you ever feel like you're gettting stuck or frustrated (in a bad way), do not hesitate to reach
            out to #ctf on Slack and ask for help.

            <div class="hint">
                <h3>What is a CTF?</h3>

                A capture-the-flag exercise is one or more problems that each involve delving into the source code or
                compiled code of a website, program or mobile application to retrieve a secret value such as a password,
                token or key -- known as the "flag".

                <h3>What do I need?</h3>

                There are a few tools that will make your life a lot easier as a reverse engineer.
                
                <br /><br />
                
                First, be sure you are comfortable using the Chrome debugger tools (or the tools of your preferred 
                browser). It's useful to be able to look at HTML, Javascript and CSS files, along with looking at
                network traffic (for the most part the Network tab in Chrome will suffice.)

                <br /><br />

                Here are some other useful tools that may come in handy along the way!

                <br /><br />

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler">Fiddler</a> is a great HTTP traffic sniffer</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx/releases/tag/v1.2.0">JADX</a> let's you take a peek at the code for Android apps</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> takes it a step further, and lets you inspect all network traffic</li>
                </ul>

                <br />

                Outside of these tools, be sure to keep a scrap pad around (whether digital or a dead tree), and
                don't be afraid to set breakpoints, write test scripts or program to test a hypothesis!

                <h3>How deep should I dig?</h3>

                All the answers to the exercises should be available by looking at client-side code. If at some point you
                are considering attempting to find a backdoor into the service you've gone (way) too far. Similarly, you 
                should never need to find vulnerabilities or utilize any security issues to find a "solution".
