            Excellent, you managed to bypass the first layer of security -- something we had previously only dreamed 
            of doing. We can't believe this system is making us jump through all these hoops just to get to our client's
            data. Security <i>schmecurity</i>, am I right?

            Once we entered the password you gave us we were prompted for a serial key for something called "AcmeSuite". 
            Their trial period must have just expired, which means we can't get the data until we activate it. Could you
            take a look?
